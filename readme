This JavaScript tool is like a smart assistant for managing schoolwork
It helps organize information about a course, assignments, and what students submit. 
The main goal is to check if everything makes sense, gather useful details, and figure out the average scores for students.

My code contains the following functionality

1.Input Data:
courseinfo: Important details about the course, like its ID and name.
assignmentgroup: Info about all assignments, including names, due dates, and points possible.
learnersubmissions: Data on what students submitted, including learner IDs, assignment IDs, when they turned it in, and their scores.


2.Validation Functions:
isnumber: Checks if numbers are used where they should be.
isstring: Makes sure that words are used when expected.
courseidmatch: Looks if the course IDs in courseinfo and assignmentgroup match.
isvalid: A flexible tool that checks both numbers and words at the same time.

3.Date Comparison:
islate: Figures out if a student handed in their work late by comparing due dates with submission times.
Data Extraction Functions:
extractassignmentdata: Picks out info about assignments and shows them in an easy-to-read way.
extractlearnerassignmentdata: Takes out details about what each student submitted and organizes them neatly.

4.Data Processing:
processAssignmentData: Takes care of organizing assignment and submission data. It figures out if a submission was late, not yet due, or on time, and puts all the info in an easy-to-understand format.
getLearnerData: The big boss that manages everything. It makes sure the data is okay, tries to do the processing, and catches errors if something goes wrong.


The code has lots of comments to help you understand what's going on.
Make sure the data is in the right format, and double-check if the course IDs match for accurate processing.
